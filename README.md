Welcome to the **Zero to Full-Stack Hero Series** by Robert Mollentze. This tutorial series is designed to take you from a complete beginner to a confident full-stack developer, building modern **mobile and web applications** with **Dart** and **Flutter**.

This repository contains the **supplementary source code** for the series, updated weekly with new lessons, projects, and examples. Whether you're new to coding or leveling up your full-stack skills, this series offers practical, hands-on projects to guide you every step of the way.

### What You'll Learn

- **Dart and Programming Fundamentals**: Master variables, functions, object-oriented programming, and async programming in Dart.
- **Frontend**: Build responsive, cross-platform user interfaces with Flutter for Android, iOS, and web.
